It's a silly procedural program to add a few numbers.

* v1.0: operatedIntermediary() is deprecated in favor of operate() which applies the mathematical operation on lastResult in case arg2 is undefined. 

* v0.1: added operateIntermediary() function in order to be able to calculate by passing add/subtract/divide/multiply functions and two numbers  to the function.
